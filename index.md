## The Ultrabucket Pro

Rami Dabit, Kyle Kam

Abstract: The Ultrabucket Pro is a bucket hat designed to prevent the user from walking into objects. Using an ultrasonic distance sensor to monitor the distance in front of the user, the hat will play a series of beeps with frequency inversely proportional to the distance. As the user gets closer and closer to an object, quicker and quicker beeps will be transmitted to either a bluetooth speaker or earbuds. If there is too much distance remaining, then no noise will be played. The device can be turned on and off by spinning the hat quickly in any direction, and the onboard gyroscope will be used to measure the spin and determine whether it crosses a certain threshold.
